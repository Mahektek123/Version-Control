Task - Build and deploy a NextJs app to Vercel using the following criteria:

Stack - NextJs (Use server components where relevant), TS, Vanila CSS (Styling should be responsive), Contentful CMS, Statsig AB Testing (https://statsig.com/)Requirements:

Use the App router. Implement Catch-all Segments for generic routing.
The slugs must be set in Contentful.
All pages must have a global header that contains the title of the page and a Main area for page-specific components/content.

Use redux to store the following appState:
{
isLoaded:boolean // default false, set to true after the page has fully loaded. Displays the sentence "The has fully loaded." in the global footer.
}

For content, setup content-models for pages, cards (model details ahead) and assets in Contentful CMS.
Add a page with the slug "/ab-test-card" with just a card in it. Title of the page = "AB Testing Card using Statsig"

Next implement AB Testing using https://statsig.com/.

Version A features:Card should have the following features (in the order mentioned):

Version B features:
Thumbnail image of a landscape, title "This is Card B", description "This card will turn light grey on hover.",  and change background colour to light grey on hover.
